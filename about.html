            <h2>About Me & Purpose of the Site</h2>
            <p>Welcome to <strong>SajiloStudy</strong>! My name is Amit, and I created this website to assist Nepali students in their educational journey. As a student myself, I understand the challenges faced by students in Nepal, especially with limited access to resources. This platform is designed to provide easily accessible learning materials, including past questions, study notes, important formulas, and educational videos to help students improve their academic performance.</p>
            
            <p>The goal of <strong>SajiloStudy</strong> is to make learning easier and more efficient for Nepali students by providing a one-stop resource hub. Whether you're preparing for exams or simply looking to reinforce your understanding of key concepts, you'll find helpful resources here that are tailored to your needs.</p>
            
            <p>We believe that every student deserves access to quality education, and <strong>SajiloStudy</strong> aims to bridge the gap by offering these resources in a simple and easy-to-navigate format. We hope that this website will be a valuable tool in your academic success!</p>
